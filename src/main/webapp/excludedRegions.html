<div>
  If set, and Jenkins is set to poll for changes, Jenkins will ignore any files and/or folders in this list when determining if a build needs to be triggered.
  <p/>Each exclusion uses regular expression pattern matching, and must be separated by a new line.
  <p/>
  <pre>
	 src/main/web/.*\.html
	 src/main/web/.*\.jpeg
	 src/main/web/.*\.gif
  </pre>
  The example above illustrates that if only html/jpeg/gif files have been committed to the SCM a build will not occur.
  <p/>More information on regular expressions can be found <a href="http://www.regular-expressions.info/">here</a>.
