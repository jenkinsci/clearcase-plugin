  <p>
	The plugin will create a view in the workspace with the specified view tag.
	The view tag is a server identifier which must be unique on a ClearCase server.
	</p>
	<p>
	If you have several jobs that uses this ClearCase plugin you need to specify a unique view 
	tag for each job. To help creating unique view tags, there are two macros that will be 
	replaced in the view name.
	<ol>
		<li><tt>${NODE_NAME}</tt> is replaced with the name of the node</li>
		<li><tt>${JOB_NAME}</tt> is replaced with the name of the job</li>
		<li><tt>${USER_NAME}</tt> is replaced with the name of the user that is running Jenkins</li>
		<li><tt>${DASH_WORKSPACE_NUMBER}</tt> is replaced by the number of the workspace if it isn't the primary workspace on the slave. This allows to execute several concurrent builds of the same job on the same slave.</li>
	</ol>
  </p>
  <p>
  	The view tag is available as an environment variable named <code>CLEARCASE_VIEWTAG</code>.
