  <p>
    If set, Hudson will use a dynamic view instead of a snapshot view. Hudson will behave differently when
    working with a dynamic view. It will not create or remove the view so the "Use update" configuration is
    ignored if this option is enabled. The plugin will update the config spec of the view when needed.
  </p>
  <p>
    To use this option, the "View tag" should be the same as specified in the "View name" field.
