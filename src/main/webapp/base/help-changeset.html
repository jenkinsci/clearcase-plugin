	<b>No History</b> means no changeset will be calculated for any build. This can be useful to make jobs that build on a readonly stream, on which you don't want the difference between two successive builds
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Current branch</b> means changeset will be calculated from changes done on current branch.
  </p>
  <p>
    <b>Use updt file</b> means changeset will be calculated from updt file generated after checkout. It's only usable with snapshot views and will provide last changes between two checkouts only. This can be useful if config spec is dynamically changeable or if it includes many branches and labels.
