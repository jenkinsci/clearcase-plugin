	To make sure that the repository is not changed during the build process,
        this option enables you to look the stream during the whole build.
        This means that no users can make a deliver to the stream during the build.
        The user that is running Hudson must have sufficient rights in the ClearCase vob to perform
        a lock on the stream.
